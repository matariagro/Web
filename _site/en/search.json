    "desc"     : "Sustainable agriculture is key to maintaining a balanced and productive agricultural ecosystem. One of the main threats to rice plants in Indonesia is tungro disease, which is caused by infection with two types of viruses, namely Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) and Rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV), which are transmitted by green leafhoppers (Nephotettix virescens) in a semi-persistent manner. This disease not only reduces productivity but also affects the quality of the harvest."

Countries such as India, China, Indonesia, and Thailand account for the majority of global rice production, which is the staple food for billions of people. However, rice production is facing significant challenges, primarily due to climate change affecting various aspects of agriculture. These challenges include rising temperatures, erratic rainfall patterns, and increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters such as floods and droughts, all of which have negative impacts on crop yields and agricultural productivity."

In dealing with attacks by plant pests (OPT), an environmentally friendly approach that prioritizes ecosystem sustainability is becoming increasingly important. One concept that has emerged in this context is agroecology, which emphasizes the importance of maintaining the balance of nature in the production of cultivated crops."
