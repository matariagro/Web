Sustainable agriculture is key to maintaining a balanced and productive agricultural ecosystem. In dealing with attacks by plant pests (OPT), an environmentally friendly approach that prioritizes ecosystem sustainability is becoming increasingly important. One concept that has emerged in this context is agroecology, which emphasizes the importance of maintaining the balance of nature in the production of cultivated crops.

Agroecology views agriculture as part of a complex ecosystem, where plants, animals, and the environment interact with each other. In the context of rice pest control, the agroecological approach emphasizes the use of strategies that rely on natural enemies and maintain biodiversity in agricultural ecosystems.

The use of refugia as one strategy for controlling rice pests is a concrete example of the application of agroecological principles. Refugia provide shelter for natural enemies and predators that play a role in controlling pest populations. By maintaining biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem balance, the use of refugia can help farmers reduce their dependence on dangerous chemical pesticides.

Optimizing rice production is a major challenge for farmers in Indonesia, especially in dealing with attacks by detrimental plant pests (OPT) such as bacterial leaf blight, tungro disease, and leaf spot disease. The use of pesticides as an instant way to control rice plant pests is often relied on by farmers, but this has a negative impact on the environment and human health. Therefore, it is important to find a more environmentally friendly and sustainable solution.

One solution that can be applied is the use of refugia. Refugia are a place of protection for natural enemies and predators that are useful in controlling the population of rice plant pests. By utilizing refugia plants, farmers can increase the stability of the agricultural ecosystem, so that the pest population can be suppressed naturally.

The use of refugia in rice farming involves selecting edge plants that have a dual function as a barrier to the entry of pests into the main crop and as a shelter and alternative food provider for predators. Refugia plants ideally have characteristics such as having striking flowers, rapid regeneration, easy to plant, and can be planted in intercropping with the main crop.

Some types of plants that have the potential to be refugia are sunflowers, kenikir, and paper flowers (zinnia). These plants are attractive to natural enemies because of their striking flowers and provide alternative food sources. In addition, several types of weeds can also be used as refugia, such as weeds that provide shelter for spiders and other natural enemies.

Research has shown that the use of refugia as natural enemies of rice pests can significantly increase rice production. In addition, the use of refugia also brings ecological benefits, such as increasing biodiversity and maintaining the balance of agricultural ecosystems.

Thus, the use of refugia is one strategy that can be applied to control rice plant pests naturally and sustainably.
